<h1>Burlesque - The one and only cookbook</h1>
<p>
 Welcome to the Burlesque cookbook! It's a good thing that you've decided to learn
 this neat language. You will see that maybe despite what everyone else says that
 Burlesque is a really clever and cool language. Don't let them stop you to learn Burlesque!
 It's very much appreciated if you try to make other people learn Burlesque and maybe someday we
 can replace other languages! If this is your first programming language you're learning then
 your freaking insane, but that's a good thing. A word from the author!
<pre>
 It seems that not everybody even knows the word 'Burlesque' so I thought why not make a programming language
 and name it 'Burlesque', it'll be fun. For those offended by that word: It's part of our/a culture, get over it!
 Anyhow... Burlesque is programming language with no I/O capabilities. Some interpreters push STDIN at the start
 of a program and print out the remaining elements of the stack once the program has terminated. I hope this
 language will be very satiric, ironic, cool, neat, nasty, insane and above all useful. Whenever you are
 coding in a language and think "This language sucks..." please think about Burlesque as an alternative. Thank you.

<h2>Understanding Burlesque</h2>
<h3>Understanding the syntax</h3>
<p>
 The syntax of Burlesque is very easy. The following example
 shows the basic syntax for values. (From left to right: Int, Double, Character, String, Block)
</p>
<pre>
<span class="int">123</span> <span class="dbl">3.14159</span> <span class="chr">'A</span> <span class="str">"ABC"</span> <span class="blck">{</span><span class="int">1</span> <span class="int">2</span> <span class="int">3</span> <span class="int">4</span> <span class="int">5</span><span class="blck">}</span>
</pre>
<p>
 An identifier (you can call it command if you like) is everything else with a length of only two characters. Also
 keep in mind that spaces are optional.
</p>
<pre>
<span class="id">ps</span> <span class="id">++</span>
</pre>
<h3>Understanding the stack</h3>
<p>
 Burlesque uses a stack "behind the scene". A stack is a data structure much like a pile (or stack) of books.
 You can put (push) a book on the pile and you can take away (pop) a book from the top. Every value is automatically
 pushed in the corresponding order.
</p>
<pre>
<span class="int">1</span> <span class="int">2</span> <span class="int">3</span>
</pre>
<p>
 This code results in a stack of 
<pre>
3 -- top
2
1 -- bottom
</pre>
 There are commands which support manipulating the stack directly. These are <b>^^</b> for duplicating the
 element on the top, <b>\/</b> for swapping the two top most elemnts and <b>vv</b> for removing an element from the top.
<pre>
<span class="int">1</span> <span class="int">2</span> <span class="int">3</span> <span class="id">^^</span>
</pre>
 Results in a stack of
<pre>
3 -- top
3
2
1 -- bottom
</pre>
<pre>
<span class="int">1</span> <span class="int">2</span> <span class="int">3</span> <span class="id">vv</span>
</pre>
 Results in a stack of
<pre>
2 -- top
1 -- bottom
</pre>
and ...
<pre>
<span class="int">1</span> <span class="int">2</span> <span class="int">3</span> <span class="id">\/</span>
</pre>
 Results in a stock of
<pre>
2 -- top
3
1 -- bottom
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Understanding Blocks</h3>
<p>
 A Block is a list of values. It is also possible for a Block to contain other Blocks as well. 
 Keep in mind that a Burlesque program is just a list of value: It's a Block. A command
 is actually also just a value (but specially treated by the interpreter). Therefore, a
 Block can contain commands too.
</p>
<h3>Understanding Commands</h3>
<p>
 A command that takes two values (takes two arguments) usually pops those, does its thing, and pushes the result back.
 So doing <b>1 1 2 .+ .+</b> results in the following stacks [1],[1,1],[1,1,2],[1,3] and results finally in [4].
 What a command actually does depends on which arguments you feed it. <b>.+</b> on two integers performs an addition
 but if you feed it other stuff it'll do other stuff!
</p>
<h2>Arithmetic</h2>
<p>
 You can use Burlesque to do arithmetic for you! It supports addition <b>.+</b>, subtraction <b>.-</b>, multiplication <b>.*</b>
 division <b>./</b> and more. Keep in mind that arithmetic is only defined if applied to two values of the same type. Let's
 calculate (((1 + 2) * 3) -1) / 2! 
<pre>
<span class="int">1</span> <span class="int">2</span> <span class="id">.+</span> <span class="int">3</span> <span class="id">.*</span> <span class="int">1</span> <span class="id">.-</span> <span class="int">2</span> <span class="id">./</span>
</pre>
 First we push 1 and 2, add them together, push 3, multiply the previous result with 3, push 1, subtract 1 from the previous result, push 2, divide the previous result by 2. Pretty easy, isn't it?
