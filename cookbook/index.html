A brainfuck interpreter in Burlesque. Want to find out how it works? You will
find everything you need to know on this webpage. You can also
have a look at the <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Burlesque">Burlesque article on esolangs.org</a>.

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
Burlesque is a concatenative, dynamic typed, lazy, probably esoteric programming language. It's a pretty awesome language
which has a lot to offer you. Whether you just want to use it for golfing, obfuscation, text processing or real serious work
you are going to have a lot of fun with it. Despite people thinking code in this language looks rather unreadable (at first glance) it's actually
the total opposite of that. If you don't know a language well enough (or languages with similar syntax) it always looks unreadable to the unknowing person.
There is no arguing about that it's not the most readable language but it's pretty good. Learn it for fun or learn it to extend your knowledge
about other paradigms. You can also use it to train your programming skills (You can implement algorithm A in language L, do you know the algorithm well enough
to write it in Burlesque?). Burlesque has a very sophisticated standard library with hundreds of commands with more than 200 useful applications.

<h2>News</h2>

<p>
I updated the online version to the latest version of 1.7 (still testing though). Have fun!
</p>

<p>
Good news. The repository is back online and development on 1.7
continues. Also, I'm not sure you noticed but the latest testing
version 1.7 has been online (see Try it in your browser) for months now.
1.7 is on it's way.
</p>

<p>
Well, I was supposed to release version 1.7 but it won't happen.
You will also see that the github repository does not exist anymore.
</p>

<p>
The next version of Burlesque, version 1.7, is on its way. The planned release date is 15-Nov-2012. 
You are very welcome to talk about the language and make suggestions on irc.freenode.net in the channels #anagol or #esoteric.
