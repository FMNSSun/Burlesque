    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
    Burlesque is a concatenative, dynamic typed, lazy, probably esoteric programming language. It's a pretty awesome language
    which has a lot to offer you. Whether you just want to use it for golfing, obfuscation, text processing or real serious work
    you are going to have a lot of fun with it. Despite people thinking code in this language looks rather unreadable (at first glance) it's actually
    the total opposite of that. If you don't know a language well enough (or languages with similar syntax) it always looks unreadable to the unknowing person.
    There is no arguing about that it's not the most readable language but it's pretty good. Learn it for fun or learn it to extend your knowledge
    about other paradigms. You can also use it to train your programming skills (You can implement algorithm A in language L, do you know the algorithm well enough
    to write it in Burlesque?). Burlesque has a very sophisticated standard library with hundreds of commands with more than 200 useful applications. <b>Note: </b>
    Burlesque does not aim for speed nor is it written by a sophisticated bunch of professional developers. Burlesque is a hobby project of mine and I just
    aim for fun and functionality. Burlesque is designed for me to use as a language to rapidly solve small problems: <i>What are the permutations of "abcd"? How many
    permutations of "abcd" contain "bc"? Produce a random matrix. Some statistics stuff. Text processing and many more.</i> The language is also available for golfing on 
    <a href="http://golf.shinh.org">anarchy golf</a>. It is not meant to be used for any sorts of critical tasks because that's not what it was designed for. It was
    designed to have lots of builtin commands to solve small non critical problems in a hackish and compact way.

    <p>
    The online version is now 1.7.0-rc3. Check it out!
    </p>

    <p>
    Take part in golfing down a brainfuck interpreter in burlesque.
    See <a href="brainfuck.txt">here</a>.

    <p>
    I updated the online version to the latest version of 1.7 (still testing though). Have fun!
    </p>

    <p>
    Good news. The repository is back online and development on 1.7
    continues. Also, I'm not sure you noticed but the latest testing
    version 1.7 has been online (see Try it in your browser) for months now.
    1.7 is on it's way.
    </p>

    <p>
    Well, I was supposed to release version 1.7 but it won't happen.
    You will also see that the github repository does not exist anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
    The next version of Burlesque, version 1.7, is on its way. The planned release date is 15-Nov-2012. 
    You are very welcome to talk about the language and make suggestions on irc.freenode.net in the channels #anagol or #esoteric.
