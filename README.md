Burlesque
=========

Burlesque is a concatenative, dynamic typed, lazy, probably esoteric programming language. Burlesque is a neat command line utility that can be used as a little desktop calculator, homework helper, to manipulate files, do some statistics or even some data analysis. It's also used as a language for code-golf. If a feature is missing you can let me know through a bug report. If you encounter a bug, incorrect documentation please also create a bug report.

Current stable version: 1.7.3 (used on anagol). Latest version: 1.7.4 (not on anagol). Also check out http://fmnssun.github.com/Burlesque.

If you don't know where to start read the ```TUTORIAL.md``` and try to learn from examples on anagol: http://golf.shinh.org/l.rb?blsq. If you need help you can also consult ```#esoteric``` on ```irc.freenode.net```.

Compile
=======

You need a decently recent ghc and haskell-plattform. 

Install the required packages:

    cabal install split  haskeline mtl regex-compat parsec digits statistics

Then compile

    ghc --make main.hs -o burlesque -O3 -fforce-recomp

If you just want the "--file" option (like on golf.shinh.org) use

    ghc --make main_golf.hs -o blsq -O3 -fforce-recomp
    
Tests
=====

With Burlesque 1.7.2f I added some little tests. However, it's too late to write a comprehensive testsuite.
If you like you can fork this repo and add tests and send me a pull request. Whenever I solve a golf challenge
I'll add my solution to the testsuite (once the challenge is post mortem of course :) )

Contributing
============

I really welcome any help. However, for most of the things you'll need to know Haskell.
If you know Haskell and wanna help: VERY GOOD, contact me! (PM, Push requests whatever, IRC).

If you don't know Haskell:

You can contribute userdefined builtins. If your builtin can be expressed using other
builtins you can create a new builtin through the `Prelude.blsq` file. Just have a look at the file.
I WILL ONLY ACCEPT SUCH BUILTINS IF YOU ALSO PROVIDE THE DOCUMENTATION FOR IT AS WELL AS TESTCASES!
Thus, have a look at `tests/` and `runtests.py`.
