As I've mentioned a few places around the Int0rw3b an update to Burlesque is planned. What are the plans?

* Rewrite documentation (in Markdown)
* Plenty of new built-ins
* Some syntax extensions
* Support for true randomness (by setting a variable to a randomly generated seed at launch) [1]


For example in Burlesque 1.7.5 the ```e```-Notation will be supported:

```
blsq ) 2e5
200000
blsq ) @2e5
200000.0
```

Especially rewriting the documentation will probably take some time so I don't know when this new update is ready for release but I'll keep you posted about the progress. 

Some of the already new existing built-ins are (guess what they do :p):

```
blsq ) 5e-
0.00001
blsq ) 2e-
0.01
blsq ) 2e-4rM
0.0100
blsq ) 2e-6rM
0.010000
blsq ) 9ro3EN
{1 4 7}
```

[1]: Yes, since 1.7.4 Burlesque actually has variables, they just were never documented. 1.7.4 actually has Maps (or
as they are called in other languages: Dictionaries, KeyValueStorage).

```
blsq ) %a=5 %b=6 %a? %b? ?*
30
blsq ) %a=5 %b=6 %a? %b? DB
<"a",5><"b",6>
6
5
blsq ) %:0 "foo" 8 "bar" 9V
<"bar",9><"foo",8>
blsq ) %:0 "foo" 8 "bar" 9V"bar"ml
9
blsq ) %:0 "foo" 8 "bar" 9V"bor"ml
0
blsq ) %reverse={<-} {1 2 3}%reverse!
{3 2 1}
```

All the above things have been silently there since 1.7.4. They will of course be documented with the next planned release.
