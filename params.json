{"name":"Burlesque","tagline":"","body":"Burlesque\r\n=========\r\n\r\nBurlesque is a concatenative, dynamic typed, lazy, probably esoteric programming language. Burlesque is a neat command line utility that can be used as a little desktop calculator, homework helper, to manipulate files, do some statistics or even some data analysis. It's also used as a language for code-golf. If a feature is missing you can let me know through a bug report. If you encounter a bug, incorrect documentation please also create a bug report.\r\n\r\n```\r\nblsq ) 1234 16j0 9rn.+4cosp\r\n7 5 1 6\r\n1 2 1 9\r\n1 5 2 0\r\n3 0 6 5\r\nblsq ) 4ro)rosp\r\n1\r\n1 2\r\n1 2 3\r\n1 2 3 4\r\nblsq ) \"abc\"su\\[)**\r\n{97 98 99 97 98 98 99 97 98 99}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent stable version: 1.7.3 (used on anagol). Latest version: 1.7.4 (not on anagol). Also check out the ```BLOG/```\r\ndirectory of this repository, which contains Burlesque related blog posts.\r\n\r\nCompile\r\n=======\r\n\r\nYou need a decently recent ghc and haskell-plattform. \r\n\r\nInstall the required packages:\r\n\r\n    cabal install split  haskeline mtl regex-compat parsec digits statistics\r\n\r\nThen compile\r\n\r\n    ghc --make main.hs -o burlesque -O3 -fforce-recomp\r\n\r\nIf you just want the \"--file\" option (like on golf.shinh.org) use\r\n\r\n    ghc --make main_golf.hs -o blsq -O3 -fforce-recomp\r\n    \r\nTests\r\n=====\r\n\r\nWith Burlesque 1.7.2f I added some little tests. However, it's too late to write a comprehensive testsuite.\r\nIf you like you can fork this repo and add tests and send me a pull request. Whenever I solve a golf challenge\r\nI'll add my solution to the testsuite (once the challenge is post mortem of course :) )\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012, Roman MÃ¼ntener\r\n All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, \r\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\nRedistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\nRedistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer \r\nin the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\nNeither the name of the <ORGANIZATION> nor the names of its contributors may be\r\nused to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, \r\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE \r\nDISCLAIMED.
